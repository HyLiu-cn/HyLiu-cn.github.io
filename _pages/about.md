# 🧍‍♂️ Biography
I am currently a PhD student at the [School of Computer Science & Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), focusing on computer vision, autonomous driving, and multimodal large language modeling. I received my master's degree from [Hebei University of Science and Technology](https://www.hebust.edu.cn/) in 2021 under the supervision of Prof Yang Zhang.
